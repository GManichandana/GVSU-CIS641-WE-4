# Introduction

Diabetes is a most common disease in these world affecting major part of the population. Although it is a global concern but still most part of 
population are unaware to deal with it. When the level of glucose in our blood increased (often called hyperglycaemia) above the required level 
then the state is called Diabetes. Inability of pancreas to produce required insulin or inability to use it properly to convert glucose into energy is the 
cause of Diabetes. Diabetes majorly of 3 types : Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Insipidus, Gestational Diabetes. So in this project. It is a Data 
science project in which we need to predict whether a given data point is diabetic or not. 

Since it comes under Classification technique which is a type of Supervised Machine Learning, here the model is built using different 
classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine. The model built with K-Nearest Neighbors gave high accuracy out of all in predicting whether the given data point is
diabetic or not.

A dataset with a variety of information about people will be needed for the research, including but not restricted to age, gender, 
family medical history, lifestyle factors (diet, exercise), and results of medical tests (such as blood glucose levels). 
Publicly accessible health datasets, medical records that have been anonymized and with the proper rights, and surveys created 
especially for this project are all acceptable sources of data.
