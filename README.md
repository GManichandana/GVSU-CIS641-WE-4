# GVSU-CIS641-WE 4

Diabetes Risk Prediction System is focused on predicting whether a given data point is diabetes or not using data science techniques, for example, 
there are some needs like personalized medicine, prevention and management, and patient engagement. By this we can predict disease early, 
improve decision makingand reduces the cost and it can give better output and improves public health.

## Run Instructions
 
- Import all the required libraries.  
- Read the dataset and store it into a new variable.  
- Check the shape of the dataset.
- Check for missing values in dataset. 
- Perform the data visualization process. 
- Select the model( K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier).
